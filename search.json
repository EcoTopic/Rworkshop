    "text": "Why learn R?\n\nR does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that’s a good thing\nIn R, the results of your analysis rely on a series of written commands, and not on remembering a succession of pointing and clicking. That is a good thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data, you don’t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your results. With a stored series of commands in an R script, you can repeat running them and R will process the new dataset exactly the same way as before.\nWorking with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and spot mistakes.\nWorking with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.\n\n\nR code is great for reproducibility\nReproducibility is when someone else, including your future self, can obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.\nR integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.\nR is widely used in academia and in industries such as pharma and biotech. These organisations expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.\n\n\nR is interdisciplinary and extensible\nWith 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population genetics, and a lot more.\n\n\nR works on data of all shapes and sizes\nThe skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won’t make much difference to you.\nR is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.\nR can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.\n\n\nR produces high-quality graphics\nThe plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to visualize your data more effectively.\n\n\nR has a large and welcoming community\nThousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through mailing lists and websites such as Stack Overflow, RStudio community, and Slack channels such as the R for Data Science online community (https://www.rfordatasci.com/). In addition, there are numerous online and in person meetups organised globally through organisations such as R Ladies Global (https://rladies.org/).\n\n\nNot only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform\nAnyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.",

The RStudio IDE is also available with a commercial license and priority email support from RStudio, PBC.\nWe will use RStudio IDE to write code, navigate the files on our computer, inspect the variables we are going to create, and visualize the plots we will generate. RStudio can also be used for other things (e.g., version control, developing packages, writing Shiny apps) that we will not cover during the workshop.\n\nRStudio is divided into 4 “panes”:\n\nThe Source for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout)\nYour Environment/History (top-right) which shows all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)\nYour Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right)\nThe R Console (bottom-left)\n\nThe placement of these panes and their content can be customized (see menu, Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Pane Layout). For ease of use, settings such as background color, font color, font size, and zoom level can also be adjusted in this menu (Global Options -&gt; Appearance).\nOne of the advantages of using RStudio is that all the information you need to write code is available in a single window. Additionally, with many shortcuts, autocompletion, and highlighting for the major file types you use while developing in R, RStudio will make typing easier and less error-prone.",

    "section": "Getting set up",
    "text": "Getting set up\nIt is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text self-contained in a single folder, called the working directory. All of the scripts within this folder can then use relative paths to files that indicate where inside the project a file is located (as opposed to absolute paths, which point to where a file is on a specific computer). Working this way allows you to move your project around on your computer and share it with others without worrying about whether or not the underlying scripts will still work.\nRStudio provides a helpful set of tools to do this through its “Projects” interface, which not only creates a working directory for you, but also remembers its location (allowing you to quickly navigate to it) and optionally preserves custom settings and (re-)open files to assist resume work after a break. Go through the steps for creating an “R Project” for this tutorial below.\n\nStart RStudio.\nUnder the File menu, click on New Project. Choose New Directory, then New Project.\nEnter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/data-carpentry).\nClick on Create Project.\nDownload the code handout, place it in your working directory and rename it (e.g., data-carpentry-script.R).\n(Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.\n\nA workspace is your current working environment in R which includes any user-defined object. By default, all of these objects will be saved, and automatically loaded, when you reopen your project. Saving a workspace to .RData can be cumbersome, especially if you are working with larger datasets, and it can lead to hard to debug errors by having objects in memory you forgot you had. Therefore, it is often a good idea to turn this off. To do so, go to Tools –&gt; ‘Global Options’ and select the ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData’ on exit.’\n\n\nOrganizing your working directory\nUsing a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things organized, and will help you to find/file things in the future. This can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects. In general, you may create directories (folders) for scripts, data, and documents.\n\ndata_raw/ & data/ Use these folders to store raw data and intermediate datasets you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For the sake of transparency and provenance, you should always keep a copy of your raw data accessible and do as much of your data cleanup and preprocessing programmatically (i.e., with scripts, rather than manually) as possible. Separating raw data from processed data is also a good idea. For example, you could have files data_raw/tree_survey.plot1.txt and ...plot2.txt kept separate from a data/tree.survey.csv file generated by the scripts/01.preprocess.tree_survey.R script.\ndocuments/ This would be a place to keep outlines, drafts, and other text.\nscripts/ This would be the location to keep your R scripts for different analyses or plotting, and potentially a separate folder for your functions (more on that later).\nAdditional (sub)directories depending on your project needs.\n\nFor this workshop, we will need a data_raw/ folder to store our raw data, and we will use data/ for when we learn how to export data as CSV files, and a fig/ folder for the figures that we will save.\n\nUnder the Files tab on the right of the screen, click on New Folder and create a folder named data_raw within your newly created working directory (e.g., ~/data-carpentry/). (Alternatively, type dir.create(\"data_raw\") at your R console.) Repeat these operations to create a data and a fig folder.\n\nWe are going to keep the script in the root of our working directory because we are only going to use one file. Later, when you start create more complex projects, it might make sense to organize scripts in sub-directories.\nYour working directory should now look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it should look like at the beginning of this lesson\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe working directory\nThe working directory is an important concept to understand. It is the place from where R will be looking for and saving the files. When you write code for your project, it should refer to files in relation to the root of your working directory and only need files within this structure.\nRStudio assists you in this regard and sets the working directory automatically to the directory where you have placed your project in. If you need to check it, you can use getwd(). If for some reason your working directory is not what it should be, you can change it in the RStudio interface by navigating in the file browser where your working directory should be, and clicking on the blue gear icon “More”, and select “Set As Working Directory”. Alternatively you can use setwd(\"/path/to/working/directory\") to reset your working directory. However, your scripts should not include this line because it will fail on someone else’s computer.",

    "section": "Interacting with R",
    "text": "Interacting with R\nThe basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. We write, or code, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. We call the instructions commands and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by executing (also called running) those commands.\nThere are two main ways of interacting with R: by using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code). The console pane (in RStudio, the bottom left panel) is the place where commands written in the R language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. You can type commands directly into the console and press Enter to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.\nBecause we want our code and workflow to be reproducible, it is better to type the commands we want in the script editor, and save the script. This way, there is a complete record of what we did, and anyone (including our future selves!) can easily replicate the results on their computer.\nRStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the Ctrl + Enter shortcut (on Macs, Cmd + Return will work, too). The command on the current line in the script (indicated by the cursor) or all of the commands in the currently selected text will be sent to the console and executed when you press Ctrl + Enter. You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudio IDE.\nAt some point in your analysis you may want to check the content of a variable or the structure of an object, without necessarily keeping a record of it in your script. You can type these commands and execute them directly in the console. RStudio provides the Ctrl + 1 and Ctrl + 2 shortcuts allow you to jump between the script and the console panes.\nIf R is ready to accept commands, the R console shows a &gt; prompt. If it receives a command (by typing, copy-pasting or sent from the script editor using Ctrl + Enter), R will try to execute it, and when ready, will show the results and come back with a new &gt; prompt to wait for new commands.\nIf R is still waiting for you to enter more data because it isn’t complete yet, the console will show a + prompt. It means that you haven’t finished entering a complete command. This is because you have not ‘closed’ a parenthesis or quotation, i.e. you don’t have the same number of left-parentheses as right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks. When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click inside the console window and press Esc; this will cancel the incomplete command and return you to the &gt; prompt.",

    "section": "Seeking help",
    "text": "Seeking help\n\nSearching function documentation with ? and ??\nIf you need help with a specific function, let’s say mean(), you can type ?mean or press F1 while your cursor is on the function name. If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, but don’t know the function name, you can use the double question mark ??, for example ??kruskall. Both commands will open matching help files in RStudio’s help panel in the lower right corner. You can also use the help panel to search help directly, as seen in the screenshot.\n\n\n\nAutomatic code completion\nWhen you write code in RStudio, you can use its automatic code completion to remind yourself of a function’s name or arguments. Start typing the function name and pay attention to the suggestions that pop up. Use the up and down arrow to select a suggested code completion and Tab to apply it. You can also use code completion to complete function’s argument names, object, names and file names. It even works if you don’t get the spelling 100% correct.\n\n\nPackage vignettes and cheat sheets\nIn addition to the documentation for individual functions, many packages have vignettes – instructions for how to use the package to do certain tasks. Vignettes are great for learning by example. Vignettes are accessible via the package help and by using the function browseVignettes().\nThere is also a Help menu at the top of the RStudio window, that has cheat sheets for popular packages, RStudio keyboard shortcuts, and more.\n\n\nFinding more functions and packages\nRStudio’s help only searches the packages that you have installed on your machine, but there are many more available on CRAN and GitHub. To search across all available R packages, you can use the website rdocumentation.org. Often, a generic Google or internet search “R &lt;task&gt;” will send you to the appropriate package documentation or a forum where someone else has already asked your question. Many packages also have websites with additional help, tutorials, news and more (for example tidyverse.org).\n\n\nDealing with error messages\nDon’t get discouraged if your code doesn’t run immediately! Error messages are common when programming, and fixing errors is part of any programmer’s daily work. Often, the problem is a small typo in a variable name or a missing parenthesis. Watch for the red x’s next to your code in RStudio. These may provide helpful hints about the source of the problem.\n\nIf you can’t fix an error yourself, start by googling it. Some error messages are too generic to diagnose a problem (e.g. “subscript out of bounds”). In that case it might help to include the name of the function or package you’re using in your query.\n\n\nAsking for help\nIf your Google search is unsuccessful, you may want to ask other R users for help. There are different places where you can ask for help. During this workshop, don’t hesitate to talk to your neighbor, compare your answers, and ask for help. You might also be interested in organizing regular meetings following the workshop to keep learning from each other. If you have a friend or colleague with more experience than you, they might also be able and willing to help you.\nBesides that, there are a few places on the internet that provide help:\n\nStack Overflow: Many questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right words in your search to find them. If your question hasn’t been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on how to ask a good question.\nThe R-help mailing list: it is used by a lot of people (including most of the R core team). If your question is valid (read its Posting Guide), you are likely to get an answer very fast, but the tone can be pretty dry and it is not always very welcoming to new users.\nIf your question is about a specific package rather than a base R function, see if there is a mailing list for the package. Usually it’s included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can be accessed using packageDescription(\"&lt;package-name&gt;\").\nYou can also try to contact the package author directly, by emailing them or opening an issue on the code repository (e.g., on GitHub).\nThere are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc…). The complete list is on the R mailing lists website.\n\nThe key to receiving help from someone is for them to rapidly grasp your problem. Thus, you should be as precise as possible when describing your problem and help others to pinpoint where the issue might be. Try to…\n\nUse the correct words to describe your problem. Otherwise you might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than answering your question.\nGeneralize what you are trying to do, so people outside your field can understand the question.\nReduce what does not work to a simple reproducible example. For instance, instead of using your real data set, create a small generic one. For more information on how to write a reproducible example see this article from the reprex package. Learning how to use the reprex package is also very helpful for this.\nInclude the output of sessionInfo() in your question. It provides information about your platform, the versions of R and the packages that you are using. As an example, here you can see the versions of R and all the packages that we are using to run the code in this lesson:\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'RODBC' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nsessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16 ucrt)\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\nRunning under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)\n\nMatrix products: default\n\n\nlocale:\n[1] LC_COLLATE=English_South Africa.utf8  LC_CTYPE=English_South Africa.utf8   \n[3] LC_MONETARY=English_South Africa.utf8 LC_NUMERIC=C                         \n[5] LC_TIME=English_South Africa.utf8    \n\ntime zone: Africa/Johannesburg\ntzcode source: internal\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] RODBC_1.3-23\n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] htmlwidgets_1.6.4 compiler_4.3.1    fastmap_1.1.1     cli_3.6.2        \n [5] tools_4.3.1       htmltools_0.5.7   rstudioapi_0.15.0 yaml_2.3.8       \n [9] rmarkdown_2.26    knitr_1.45        jsonlite_1.8.8    xfun_0.42        \n[13] digest_0.6.35     rlang_1.1.3       evaluate_0.23",

While R is the underlying statistical computing environment, RStudio is the graphical IDE (integrated development environment) that makes using R easier, more intuitive, and interactive. Both are separate downloads and installations, and you will need to install R first, followed by RStudio. Once both are installed, you would just open and work in RStudio, which will run R in the background. Then you will install some R packages (collections of functions you can use in your own coding) which we are using for this workshop. Please install R version 4.3.1 or later and RStudio version 2023.09.0 or later."

    "section": "Creating objects in R",
    "text": "Creating objects in R\nYou can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:\n\n3 + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n12 / 7\n\n[1] 1.714286\n\n\nHowever, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign values to objects. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator &lt;-, and the value we want to give it:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55\n\n&lt;- is the assignment operator we will use in this course. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So, after executing x &lt;- 3, the value of x is 3. For historical reasons, you can also use = for assignments, but not in every context. Because of the slight differences in syntax, it is good practice to always use &lt;- for assignments.\nIn RStudio, typing Alt + - (push Alt at the same time as the - key) will write &lt;- in a single keystroke in a PC, while typing Option + - (push Option at the same time as the - key) does the same in a Mac.\nObjects can be given almost any name such as x, current_temperature, or subject_id. Here are some further guidelines on naming objects:\n\nYou want your object names to be explicit and not too long.\nThey cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).\nR is case sensitive, so for example, weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.\nThere are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list). In general, even if it’s allowed, it’s best to not use other function names (e.g., c, T, mean, data, df, weights). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use.\nIt’s best to avoid dots (.) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages. To avoid confusion, don’t include dots in names.\nIt is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.\nBe consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Styles can include “lower_snake”, “UPPER_SNAKE”, “lowerCamelCase”, “UpperCamelCase”, etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. In R, three popular style guides come from Google, Jean Fan and the tidyverse. The tidyverse style is very comprehensive and may seem overwhelming at first. You can install the lintr package to automatically check for issues in the styling of your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjects vs. variables\n\n\n\nWhat are known as objects in R are known as variables in many other programming languages. Depending on the context, object and variable can have drastically different meanings. However, in this lesson, the two words are used synonymously. For more information see: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Objects\n\n\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg &lt;- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\n\n\nNow that R has weight_kg in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\nWe can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\nThis means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects. For example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new object, weight_lb:\n\nweight_lb &lt;- 2.2 * weight_kg\n\nand then change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg &lt;- 100\n\nWhat do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\n\nSaving your code\nUp to now, your code has been in the console. This is useful for quick queries but not so helpful if you want to revisit your work for any reason. A script can be opened by pressing Ctrl + Shift + N. It is wise to save your script file immediately. To do this press Ctrl + S. This will open a dialogue box where you can decide where to save your script file, and what to name it. The .R file extension is added automatically and ensures your file will open with RStudio.\nDon’t forget to save your work periodically by pressing Ctrl + S.\n\n\nComments\nThe comment character in R is #. Anything to the right of a # in a script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes and explanations in your scripts. For convenience, RStudio provides a keyboard shortcut to comment or uncomment a paragraph: after selecting the lines you want to comment, press at the same time on your keyboard Ctrl + Shift + C. If you only want to comment out one line, you can put the cursor at any location of that line (i.e. no need to select the whole line), then press Ctrl + Shift + C.\n\n\nChallenge\nWhat are the values after each statement in the following?\n\nmass &lt;- 47.5            # mass?\nage  &lt;- 122             # age?\nmass &lt;- mass * 2.0      # mass?\nage  &lt;- age - 20        # age?\nmass_index &lt;- mass/age  # mass_index?\n\n\n\nFunctions and their arguments\nFunctions are “canned scripts” that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R packages (more on that later). A function usually takes one or more inputs called arguments. Functions often (but not always) return a value. A typical example would be the function sqrt(). The input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function (‘running it’) is called calling the function. An example of a function call is:\n\nweight_kg &lt;- sqrt(10)\n\nHere, the value of 10 is given to the sqrt() function, the sqrt() function calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to the object weight_kg. This function takes one argument, other functions might take several.\nThe return ‘value’ of a function need not be numerical (like that of sqrt()), and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or even a dataset. We’ll see that when we read data files into R.\nArguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below). Some functions take arguments which may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a default value: these are called options. Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.\nLet’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: round().\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere, we’ve called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it has returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting information about the round function. We can use args(round) to find what arguments it takes, or look at the help for this function using ?round.\n\nargs(round)\n\nfunction (x, digits = 0) \nNULL\n\n\n\n?round\n\nWe see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type digits = 2 or however many we want.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIf you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don’t have to name them:\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAnd if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nIt’s good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you’re rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don’t, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you’re doing.",

    "section": "Vectors and data types",
    "text": "Vectors and data types\nA vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using the c() function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign it to a new object weight_g:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(50, 60, 65, 82)\nweight_g\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\nanimals &lt;- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\")\nanimals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\nThere are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. length() tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:\n\nlength(weight_g)\n\n[1] 4\n\nlength(animals)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAn important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the same type of data. The function class() indicates what kind of object you are working with:\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe function str() provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:\n\nstr(weight_g)\n\n num [1:4] 50 60 65 82\n\nstr(animals)\n\n chr [1:3] \"mouse\" \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\nYou can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:\n\nweight_g &lt;- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector\nweight_g &lt;- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 30 50 60 65 82 90\n\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector weight_g, add the value 90 to the end of it, and save the result back into weight_g. Then we add the value 30 to the beginning, again saving the result back into weight_g.\nWe can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.\nAn atomic vector is the simplest R data type and is a linear vector of a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main atomic vector types that R uses: \"character\" and \"numeric\" (or \"double\"). These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4 atomic vector types are:\n\n\"logical\" for TRUE and FALSE (the boolean data type)\n\"integer\" for integer numbers (e.g., 2L, the L indicates to R that it’s an integer)\n\"complex\" to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 1 + 4i) and that’s all we’re going to say about them\n\"raw\" for bitstreams that we won’t discuss further\n\nYou can check the type of your vector using the typeof() function and inputting your vector as the argument.\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array).\n\nChallenge\n\nWe’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?\n\n\nSolution. R implicitly converts them to all be the same type\n\n\nWhat will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects):\nnum_char &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nnum_logical &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", TRUE)\ntricky &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, \"4\")\nWhy do you think it happens?\n\n\nSolution. Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a “common denominator” that doesn’t lose any information.\n\n\nHow many values in combined_logical are \"TRUE\" (as a character) in the following example (reusing the 2 ..._logicals from above):\ncombined_logical &lt;- c(num_logical, char_logical)\n\n\nSolution. Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the TRUE in num_logical gets converted into a 1 before it gets converted into \"1\" in combined_logical.\n\n\nYou’ve probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class coercion. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?\n\n\nSolution. logical → numeric → character ← logical",

    "text": "Missing data\nAs R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of missing data (which is uncommon in other programming languages). Missing data are represented in vectors as NA.\nWhen doing operations on numbers, most functions will return NA if the data you are working with include missing values. This feature makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument na.rm = TRUE to calculate the result as if the missing values were removed (rm stands for ReMoved) first.\n\nheights &lt;- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)\nmean(heights)\n\n[1] NA\n\nmax(heights)\n\n[1] NA\n\nmean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4\n\nmax(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nIf your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the functions is.na(), na.omit(), and complete.cases(). See below for examples.\n\n## Extract those elements which are not missing values.\nheights[!is.na(heights)]\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\n\n## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.\n#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `\"numeric\"` (or #`\"double\"`).\nna.omit(heights)\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\nattr(,\"na.action\")\n[1] 4\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"omit\"\n\n## Extract those elements which are complete cases.\n#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `\"numeric\"` (or #`\"double\"`).\nheights[complete.cases(heights)]\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\n\n\nRecall that you can use the typeof() function to find the type of your atomic vector.\n\nChallenge\n\nUsing this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, heights_no_na, with the NAs removed.\n\nheights &lt;- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)\n\nUse the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.\nUse R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.\n\n\nSolution. \n\nheights &lt;- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)\n\n# 1.\nheights_no_na &lt;- heights[!is.na(heights)]\n# or\nheights_no_na &lt;- na.omit(heights)\n# or\nheights_no_na &lt;- heights[complete.cases(heights)]\n\n# 2.\nmedian(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 64\n\n# 3.\nheights_above_67 &lt;- heights_no_na[heights_no_na &gt; 67]\nlength(heights_above_67)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R’s data structures, we are ready to start working with the Portal dataset we have been using in the other lessons, and learn about data frames.\n\n\n&lt;- is used to assign values on the right to objects on the left\nCode should be saved within the Source pane in RStudio to help you return to your code later.\n\n‘#’ can be used to add comments to your code.\nFunctions can automate more complicated sets of commands, and require arguments as inputs.\nVectors are composed by a series of values and can take many forms.\nData structures in R include ‘vector’, ‘list’, ‘matrix’, ‘data.frame’, ‘factor’, and ‘array’.\nVectors can be subset by indexing or through logical vectors.\nMany functions exist to remove missing data from data structures.",
