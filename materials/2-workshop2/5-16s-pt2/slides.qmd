## Intro: Exploratory Data Analysis vs modelling

## Correlations are exploratory / observational

## Correlations can be spurious

## spurious example

## How do we perform correlations on microbial taxa?

## one at a time

## spearman vs pearson

## what to do with zeros

## build a grid

## heatmap

## wooclap of heatmap interpretation

## correlations of taxa with other taxa

## interpretation

## exercise

## modelling

## now we are talking about potentially causal interpretations

## what kinds of questions are we asking?

## how do we build a causal model?

## how do we convert that model into a statistical model?

## Test one taxa at a time

## interpret the model

## testing multiple taxa

## wooclap interpretting the multiple taxa

## showing results of modelling as a tree

## interpretting the tree

## distinction between real phylogenetic tree and this abomination

## wooclap

## exercise on
