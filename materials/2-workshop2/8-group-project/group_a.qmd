##### Research Project A \
## Does yogurt consumption change the vaginal microbiome? ![](images/birth_control.png){width=15%}

{{< include group_activity_1_yogurt_starter.qmd >}}

<!-- #### **Description**  
This is a randomized controlled trial to study whether yogurt consumption has an effect on the microbiome post antibiotic treatment. 16S rRNA sequencing was done to characterize patient microbiome composition. Absolute abundance of bacteria (in gene copies / mL) was measured by 3 qPCR assays (for total, L. crispatus, L. iners). Cytokine levels (in ug/mL of vaginal fluid) were also measured by Luminex. Data was collected at two timepoints, pre and post antibiotic treatment.

<!-- ## Questions and Aims

#### **16S Processing** \

- Identify project files on your instance
  - What does the count table represent? What are the columns and rows?
- Subset phyloseq object by yogurt dataset samples
  - Filter count table by yogurt samples
  - Remove unused ASVs
  - Filter tax_table by the ASVs    
- Merge data from other assays
  - Which columns should you use to merge columns?
- Create phyloseq object
- Phyloseq cleaning (Liz's slides)
  - Fix NAs
<!-- * Optional: Can you use the control samples to test Dada2's accuracy? -->
 


<!-- #### **Exploring High Dimensional Data** \
- Plot the microbiome!
- Generate plots to compare relative abundance across arms and time points
  - What are noticable differences after antibiotic treatment?
  - **Does consumption of yogurt influence patient's microbiome?**
- How do cytokines correlate with Lactobacillus?  
- Which cytokines correlate with certain taxa?
  - Create a heatmap
- How do the absolute abundance of bacteria change after antibiotic administration?
- Are there ways to change the scale so that taxa at lower abundance can be more easily visualized? (transformations)
- Optional: Use microViz to explore the phyloseq object

#### **Further Analysis**

- Microbiome diversity
  - Compute Shannon Indices

- Ordination
  - What are some distance metrics? --> -->
