all_samples_tax_table <- readRDS("data/Group B Dataset Menstruation/gv_spetab_nobim_silva.rds")
```

### Make a phyloseq obj

```{r}
#creating sample data for the phyloseq
bc_sample_data <- amplicon_ids %>%
    left_join(samp_id %>% select(-arm), by = c("pid","time_point")) %>% # merges sample ids
    left_join(participant_metadata %>% select(-arm), by = "pid") %>% # merges participant metadata
    mutate(arm_timepoint = str_c(arm, time_point, sep = "_")) %>%#creating a arm and timepoint column for later plotting
    left_join(flow, by = "sample_id") %>% # merges flow
    left_join(luminex %>% # merges luminex
        pivot_wider(names_from = cytokine, values_from = c(conc,limits)), by = "sample_id") %>% 
    mutate(arm_timepoint = str_c(arm, time_point, sep = "_")) %>%
    column_to_rownames("amplicon_sample_id")


```

### Extract samples of interest : bc= birth control

```{r}
bc_ids <- bc_sample_data %>% 
              as.data.frame() %>% 
              rownames_to_column("amplicon_sample_id") %>%
              pull(amplicon_sample_id)
```

### Remove unused ASVs from the count table

```{r}
count_table <- all_samples_count_table %>%
                as.data.frame() %>%
                rownames_to_column("amplicon_sample_id") %>%
                filter(amplicon_sample_id %in% bc_ids) %>% #filtering the count data by bc ids
                mutate_at(vars(-amplicon_sample_id), as.numeric) %>%
                column_to_rownames("amplicon_sample_id") %>%
                select(where(~sum(.) != 0)) # removing unused ASVs - when the sum of a column is 0
```

### Sparsity of my count table

```{r}
a<-as.matrix(count_table)
class(a)
sum(a == 0) / length(a)
##0.97
```

```{r}
data.frame(asv_prev = colSums(a > 0)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = asv_prev)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "Number of samples in which the ASV was detected",
       y = "Number of ASVs")
sum(is.na(a))
#0
```

Most ASVs are absent from most samples. Sparsity is a common characteristic of microbiome data due to several reasons:

Biological Diversity: Microbiome samples often contain a large number of microbial taxa, but each individual taxa may be present in only a subset of samples. Sequencing Depth: The depth of sequencing may not be sufficient to capture all microbial taxa present in a sample, leading to many undetected taxa. Experimental Conditions: Factors such as sample handling, DNA extraction methods, and PCR amplification biases can influence which taxa are detected and at what abundance.

### Explore the distribution of ASV lengths.

 Are there any you’d like to remove?

#### Length 
using getSequences from the dada2 package

```{r}
table(nchar(getSequences(a)))
```

nchar shows you a table of each length and the number of ASVs which have that length We can visualize this using hist

```{r}
hist(nchar(getSequences(a)),
     main="Distribution of sequence lengths")
```

You may want to remove the outliers. I specified my desired length to be between 400 and 440

```{r}
seqtab <- a[,nchar(colnames(a)) %in% seq(400, 440)]

# % of reads with desired length
sum(seqtab)/sum(a)
```

This is not bad because we still retain 99% of our reads. Let us visualize them after filtering 🧐

```{r}
hist(nchar(getSequences(seqtab)),
     main="Distribution of sequence lengths")
```

### Filter the taxa table to only keep birth contr ASVs

```{r}
#asvs <- colnames(count_table)
asvs <- colnames(seqtab)
```

### Make a taxa table

```{r}
#filter the taxa table so there is only asvs for the bc samples
tax_table <- all_samples_tax_table %>%
              as.data.frame() %>%
              rownames_to_column("tax_table_asv") %>%
              filter(tax_table_asv %in% asvs) %>% # filters the tax table by the asvs we want
              column_to_rownames("tax_table_asv") %>%
              as.matrix()
```

### Are there NAs in the tax table?

```{r}
class(tax_table)
sum(is.na(tax_table))
#2112 NAs
```

Many! What could be the source of NAs in the taxa table?

### Create a birth contr specific phyloseq object

```{r}
#creating phyloseq object
bc_ps <- phyloseq(otu_table(seqtab,#count_table,
                            taxa_are_rows=FALSE), 
               sample_data(bc_sample_data), 
               tax_table(tax_table))
```

### Phyloseq cleaning and diagnosis
Describe the structure of the experimental design \
Aim To investigate whether taking birth control is associated with vaginal inflammation throughout the menstrual cycle.

Study Description This is an observational study to evaluate the relationship between birth control and vaginal inflammation in response to menstruation. 16S rRNA sequencing was done to characterize patient microbiome composition. Cytokine levels (in ug/mL of vaginal fluid) were also measured by Luminex. We also looked at the number and type of immune cells in the vagina using Flow Cytometry. Data was collected at four timepoints; before, at the start, the end, and after menstruation.

### Make a long phyloseq data frame

psmelt will provide us with a data frame with all the variables within the phyloseq object

```{r}
ps_df<-psmelt(bc_ps)
names(ps_df)
```

##Research question Does Birth control #arm change inflammation #8 cells and 8 cytokines during menstruation? \# time_point relative to menstruation period \# Assess the study design To do this, I extracted variables of interest from the melted phyloseq object

```{r}
my_variables<-ps_df %>% 
  select(arm, pid, Abundance, time_point,
        conc_IL.1a:conc_MIP.3a  # columns with cytokines
         ) %>% distinct()

names(my_variables)
```

To plot the variables, I used pivot_longer() so that my cytokines and concentrations can be in long format, and in two distinct columns

```{r}
my_variables<-my_variables %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols= conc_IL.1a:conc_MIP.3a,
               names_to = 'cytokines',
               values_to='concentration')
names(my_variables)

my_variables %>% 
  # checking if there is 16S data available for each individual
  mutate(detected = concentration > 1) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x=time_point,y=pid, 
             color= detected))+ # color indicates detectebility of cytokine conc
  geom_point()+  # point indicates availability of cytokine value for each individual 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(arm), cols = vars(cytokines), scales = "free_y")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+ 
  labs(title = "Study Design", y = "Participant ID")
```

Here we can observe that in both arms, birth control and no birth control, cytokines such as IFNg , IL1_b, IL.6, MIP3 and TNFa have low concentrations a week prior and a week post menstruation. This could be an indicationg of a subsiding inflammatory response. In contrast , the cytokine MIP.3 is showing decrease in cytokine concentrations at onset and at the end of bleeding.

### Removal of low yield samples 
### Calculate total read counts per sample

```{r}
sample_sums(bc_ps)
sample_sums <- sample_sums(bc_ps)
```

I look at the summary statistics to see assess the distribution of read counts for most samples

```{r}
summary(sample_sums)
## Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#    2766   40084   56452   53351   65059  103025
```

You want to exclude samples with exremely low sequecing depth but still retai majority of your samples.

These samples have a relatively good amount of reads, looking at the first quartile, 25% of these samples have about 40084 reads. To balance out the sequencing depth, I will remove samples that have half the Q2 value. This is because I want to retain a sufficient number of samples for downstream analysis while still using samples with a relatively high sequencing depth. This is totally dependent on how bad your yield is. if you lose a lot of samples you might have to repeat your sequencing and revise your library prep.

```{r}
# Create a dataframe for plotting
sample_sums_df <- data.frame(Sample = names(sample_sums), Total_Reads = sample_sums)
# Plot 
ggplot(sample_sums_df, aes(y = Total_Reads, x=Sample)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Sample", y = "Total reads", title = "Distribution of Total Reads per Sample") +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept =20000,colour = 'red')) # shows my specified threshold 
```

When I set a threshold of 20000 I will lose 10 samples.

```{r}
# Plot 
ggplot(sample_sums_df, aes(x = Total_Reads)) +
  #geom_point()+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Total Reads", y = "Frequency", title = "Distribution of Total Reads per Sample", color= 'Threshold') +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept =20000,colour = 'red'))
```

### Define a threshold for minimum total read count and remove empty ASVs

```{r}
min_total_reads <- 20000  # change to your desired threshold 

# Filter samples based on total read count
filtered_physeq <-
  prune_samples(sample_sums >= min_total_reads, bc_ps) %>%
  # Drop empty ASVs
  filter_taxa(., function(x) sum(x > 0) > 0, prune = TRUE) %>% 
  # # Drop sporadic families
   filter_taxa(., function(x) sum(x > 0.01) > 2, prune = TRUE) 
  
  
  
# Check the number of samples before and after filtering
print(paste("Number of samples before filtering:", length(sample_names( bc_ps))))

print(paste("Number of samples after filtering:", length(sample_names(filtered_physeq))))

# Now 'filtered_physeq' contains only the samples with total read counts above the threshold
```

```{r}
min(taxa_sums(filtered_physeq))
```

```{r}
#sample_variables(bc_ps)
```

### Taxa fix

```{r}
ps_manual_taxonomy <- filtered_physeq %>%
  tax_fix() %>%
  tax_mutate(Species = case_when(
    Species ==  "acidophilus/casei/crispatus/gallinarum" ~ "crispatus",
    Species == "crispatus/gasseri/helveticus/johnsonii/kefiranofaciens" ~ "crispatus",
    Species == "animalis/apodemi/crispatus/murinus" ~ "crispatus",
    .default = Species)) %>%
    #also remake genus_species to fix those taxa
    tax_mutate(genus_species = str_c(Genus, Species, sep = " ")) %>%
    tax_rename(rank = "genus_species")
```

Generate plots to compare relative abudances across arms and time points What are some noticable differences throughout menstruation? #Does birth control change inflammation during menstruation? \
Optional questions (Examine your sample_data to see what other questions you can ask!):

### What cytokines correlated with Lactobaccilus? #What cytokines correlate with certain taxa? How do the absolute abundance of bacteria and #Lactobacillus species change throughout menstruation?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
 ps_manual_taxonomy %>%
  tax_fix() %>%
  tax_agg("genus_species") %>%
  ps_seriate() %>% # this changes the order of the samples to be sorted by similarity
  comp_barplot(tax_level = "genus_species", sample_order = "asis", n_taxa = 10) +
  facet_wrap(vars(arm, time_point), scales="free_x")+
  theme( axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
         axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), # removed x axis labels because they are ineligible 
          legend.position = "bottom") 
```

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
# Reorder the appearance of time_point
sample_data(ps_manual_taxonomy)$time_point <- factor(
  sample_data(ps_manual_taxonomy)$time_point, 
  levels = c("week_prior", "onset", "end_bleeding", "week_post")
)

ps_manual_taxonomy %>%
  tax_fix() %>%
  tax_agg("genus_species") %>%
  ps_seriate() %>%
  comp_barplot(tax_level = "genus_species", sample_order = "asis", n_taxa = 15) +
  facet_wrap(vars(arm, time_point), scales = "free_x") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom")

```

These plots are showing us that there is an increased diversity of microbes at onset until the end of the period. a diverse community of microbes can be detected at onset in the birth control group, in contrast, the group without birth control starts of with a shift of dominance from lacto to Atopobium, Gardnerella and Prevotella ,increased diversity is only observed later, at the end of bleeding.

What else can you derive from the plot?

```{r}
#ps_manual_taxonomy %>% ord_explore()
```

### Does birth control change inflammation during menstruation?

  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
         legend.position = "bottom")+
    labs(title = "Lactobacillus throughout periods")
```

```{r}
ps_df<-ps_manual_taxonomy %>%
    microViz::ps_melt() %>% 
    group_by(Sample, pid, arm, time_point, sample_id, arm_timepoint, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, genus_species) %>%
    summarise(count = sum(Abundance)) %>%
    group_by(Sample) %>%
    mutate(rel_abundance = count / sum(count)) %>%
    ungroup()

cytokine_data <- ps_manual_taxonomy %>% 
  samdat_tbl() %>%
  select(.sample_name, sample_id, arm, time_point, arm_timepoint, starts_with("conc"))


```

### Correlation plots

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
ps_df%>% # melted phyloseq
  filter(Genus == "Lactobacillus") %>%
  left_join(cytokine_data, by = c("Sample" = ".sample_name", "arm_timepoint")) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(starts_with("conc")), names_to = "analyte", values_to = "conc") %>%
  filter(!str_detect(analyte, "log")) %>%
  mutate(analyte = str_replace(analyte, "conc_", "")) %>%
  group_by(analyte) %>%
  mutate(cor = cor(rel_abundance, conc, method="spearman") %>% scales::label_number(accuracy = 0.01)()) %>%
  mutate(facet_label = str_c(analyte, " *(ρ = ", cor, ")*")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rel_abundance, y = conc)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = arm_timepoint)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2", guide = NULL) +
  scale_y_log10(labels=scales::label_log()) +
  facet_wrap(vars(facet_label), scales="free_y") +
  theme_cowplot() + 
  background_grid() + 
  theme(axis.title.x = ggtext::element_markdown(), strip.text =  ggtext::element_markdown())


```

Here, we learn that there is no correlation between the analytes (cytokines) and the abundance of lactobacillus. However, this might not be true at different time points, for example if we had grouped by analyte and time_point prior to calculating the correlation , then facet the plot by both analyte and time_point. Try it and see if theres any correlation at different time points.

### Exploring within-sample diversity (Alpha Diversity)

Does your data contain singletons? Calculate alpha diversity using three different diversity measures Is there a difference in alpha diversity between the birth control and no birth control arms? How about across menstruation? Is the difference between arms statistically significant?

### Singletons

```{r}
sum(otu_table(filtered_physeq) == 1)
# not enough to calculate chao1 whichh requires unfiltered data and more single ASVs
```

```{r}
ps_df<-ps_manual_taxonomy %>%
    microViz::ps_melt() %>% 
    group_by(Sample, pid, arm, time_point, sample_id, arm_timepoint, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, genus_species) %>%
    summarise(count = sum(Abundance)) %>%
    group_by(Sample) %>%

#                 names_to='cytokines', 
#                 values_to='concentration')

```

```{r}

# add my ps_melt object for additional variables 
alpha_div_df<-alpha_div %>% left_join(metadata) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Observed:Simpson,
    names_to='metric',
    values_to = 'score') 


# Plot alpha diversity metrics
alpha_div_df %>% distinct() %>% 
  filter(time_point %in% c('onset', 'week_post') ) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = arm, y = score)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  
  geom_quasirandom(stroke = FALSE, width = 0.3) + 
  labs(x = "Alpha diversty metric", y = "Score") +
  #facet_wrap(~arm, scales = "free_y") +

   stat_compare_means(method = "wilcox.test", paired = FALSE, label="p.signif")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90))

```

### How about across menstruation?

```{r}
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 10
# Plot alpha diversity metrics
alpha_div_df %>% distinct() %>% 
  #filter(time_point=='onset') %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = arm, y = as.numeric(score))) +
  geom_boxplot() +  
  labs(x = "Alpha diversty metric", y = "Score") +
  #facet_wrap(~arm, scales = "free_y") +
   facet_wrap(time_point~metric, scales = "free_y") +
  stat_compare_means(aes(group=arm), method = "wilcox.test", paired = FALSE, label="p.signif")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 90))

```

Here we can observe that there is no significant difference in Alpha diversity of individuals who were on birth control and individuals who were not on birth control. This implies that changes that we seee in diversity may not be attributed to the use of contraceptives but those changes may be a result of other factors such as the the time relative to the menstruation period ( a week prior, onset,the end and a week post). \# Beta diversity

```

Samples from the onset and end of bleeding have clustered together on the left, indicating that the relative abundancesn of taxa in these samples are similar compared to the rest of the samples. Samples from a week prior and week post bleeding have also clustered together. What could that indicate?

After the completion of periods, the microbiome reverts back to the abundances of taxa it had prior to the onset of periods. #Create Microbiome heatmaps ##Annotate the heatmap with arms and/or timepoints

Here we can observe that there is no apparent difference in the relative abundances of the top classes of species in individuals who were on birth control and individuals who were not on birth control. This is consistent with what we observed from the alpha diversity plots earlier.

Negative correlation between lactobacillus and IL1_a as seen by the blue color. From Escherichia to Veillonella there is a trend of positive correlation with certain inflammatory markers,from ifn_g to il_6. In contrast , Lactobacillus has a negative correlation with the same set of markers. What other trends can you observe?
