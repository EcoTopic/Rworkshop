## Does birth control change inflammation during menstruation? ![](images/birth_control.png){width=15%}

#### Questions and aims for birth control dataset (!To be updated with birth control data and lecture slide notes)
**16S processing** \

* Identify project files on your instance
* What are some pre-processing steps to take before running Dada2?
* What can you say about the quality of the reads?
* Merge data from other assays 
* Generate a phyloseq object
* Phyloseq cleaning
* Optional: Can you use the control samples to test Dada2's accuracy?
 

**16S analysis**

* Generate plots to compare relative abundance across arms and time points
* What are noticable differences after antibiotic treatment?
* **Does consumption of yogurt influence people's microbiome?**
* Are there ways to change the scale so that taxa at lower abundance can be more easily visualized?
* Use a distance metric and explain what it means when comparing across groups
* Conduct differential abundance testing (simply wilcoxon or using DESeq2?)
* Incorporate shotgun metagenomic data into the phyloseq
* Optional: Use microViz to explore the phyloseq object
