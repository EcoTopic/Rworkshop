## The premise of the workshop

We've extended the true-to-life dataset from workshop 1 to include high dimensional 16S data

- about 40 participants split across two treatment arms
- three time points (before treatment, after treatment, and longer follow-up)
- several measurements per time-point including cytokine concentrations and flow cytometry data
- 16S sequencing for every time point, as well as microbial gene counts from shotgun metagenomics

We've also created group datasets so you can practice applying what you've learned on new data.  

## Why this format

We've taught workshops here before where we packed a lot (too much) into one week.

Based on feedback, we focused on basic R skills at the first workshop, and will spend this week using R to analyze microbiome data as a case-study in higher dimensional data analysis.

This is the first time running this new workshop - please give lots of feedback on how to improve it for next time.

## The content of this workshop

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em"}
We've created 6 modules as well as a group activity for this workshop.  
\
There might be too much material to get through in this week!  
\
As instructors we're going to be trying to teach at the right pace to keep everyone learning all week.  
\
The materials will stay on the website forever for you to work through at your own pace.
