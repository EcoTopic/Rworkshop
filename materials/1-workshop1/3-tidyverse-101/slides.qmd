## Group Pen and Paper exercise {.your-turn}

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(10, left=0, right=NULL)
countdown::countdown(30)
```

Get with your group.
Go to [this module](index.html/#data-visualization-activity)

1. For the first 10 minutes think on your own
2. For 30 minutes discuss with your group and produce at least one plot
3. Someone post a picture on the [{{< fa brands discord >}} #pen-and-paper-activity](https://discord.com/channels/1158136582201692202/1160951454417301585) channel.
4. Decide on one member of your group to present your plot (3 minute limit per group)

*Note, you can press `'b'` on your keyboard when the slides are full screen to bring up a blackboard. `'b'` again to close. `'del'` to clear your drawing.*

## Presentation {.your-turn}

Have one member from your group present the plot  to everyone! 3 minute limit!

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(3)
```

## The elements of data visualization

Plots map data onto graphical elements
