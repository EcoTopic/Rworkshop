## The premise of the workshop

We've created a true-to-life "medium dimensional" dataset that we'll use for all instruction 

- about 40 participants split across two treatment arms
- three time points (before treatment, after treatment, and longer follow-up)
- several measurements per time-point including cytokine concentrations and flow cytometry data  (more from Salina and Suuba next!)

We've also created group datasets so you can practice applying what you've learned on new data.  

## Why this format

We've taught workshops here before where we packed a lot (too much) into one week.

Based on feedback, we're trying to focus on R for the whole week, and to make the example data relevant to a lot of your actual work.

However, many of you in the room know a lot more immunology than us - and even if you know none you can learn the R and generalize it to your research.

This is the first time running this new workshop - please give lots of feedback on how to improve it for next time.

## The content of this workshop

:::{style="font-size: 1.2em"}
We've created 7 modules as well as a group activity for this workshop.  
\
This is probably too much material to get through in this week!  
\
As instructors we're going to be trying to teach at the right pace to keep everyone learning all week.  
\
The materials will stay on the website forever for you to work through at your own pace.
